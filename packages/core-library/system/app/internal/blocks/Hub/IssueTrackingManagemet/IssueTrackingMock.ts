    description: 'I am currently unable to log in to my account using my email and password. Every time I attempt to sign in, I receive an "invalid credentials" error, even though I am absolutely certain that I am entering the correct email address and password. I have carefully checked for any typos, ensured that my Caps Lock key is off, and even tried logging in from a different browser and device, but the issue persists. In an effort to resolve the problem, I attempted to reset my password using the "Forgot Password" option. However, after submitting my request, I never received the password reset email in my inbox or spam folder. I even waited for an extended period and retried multiple times, but no email ever arrived. Could you please assist me in resolving this issue? I would appreciate any guidance on how to regain access to my account.',

I received an error message stating that the payment couldn’t be processed, even though my card has sufficient funds. I double-checked my details, refreshed the page, and even tried a different browser, but the issue persisted. There were no alerts from my bank, so I’m not sure what went wrong. Could you look into this and let me know what I can do to resolve it?",

I’ve tried refreshing the page, using a different browser, and even reducing the file size, but nothing seems to work. Could you check if there’s an issue on your end or let me know what else I can try?",
